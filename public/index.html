<p>This is my blog&hellip; I guess.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been wanting to find a place to collect and share my ideas for years now. Hopefully this becomes a regular habit that I can maintain for years, but we need to start small by starting the site and introducing what I do.</p>

	<div class="entry__content"><p>Gods and worship have been quintessential aspect of the human experience since all of known human history. Yet, there are those of us who have chosen to defy these well established rules of society. Why you have chosen to abandon a creator framework for life is, to me, irrelevant, but I do want to make a claim that the conception for god is a useful tool for navigating life and our journey of self discovery and self improvement.</p></div>

<p>I don’t kill anything! To make that clear off the bat, but I tend to notice when things break or plants die right as major changes happen. And it’s all because of that damn witch in my home town!</p>
<h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>
<p>Eight years ago I wore a promise ring that my girlfriend at the time bought me as a going to college present. I loved that thing as it reminded me of her while also being a beautiful ring and sturdy too. I had it for a year totally unscathed. When one day at work I smacked my hand against a stainless steel counter and I noticed the citrine (her favorite rock) set into it had cracked.</p></div>

These are signals in your mind that you need to transition into a new mindset. You are no longer in sleeping mode and need to be in awake mode. The ritual of Coffee or Tea in the morning is more a symbolic waking up than it is a necessity for caffeine.</p></div>

<p>“A man standing by a spring of clear, sweet water and cursing it. While the fresh water keeps on bubbling up. He can shovel mud into it, or dung, and the stream will carry it away, wash itself clean, remain unstained.”<br>
― Marcus Aurelius, Meditations</p>

<h2 id="human-nature-and-habits">Human Nature and Habits</h2>
<p>Humans are an ever growing ever changing beast, but through habits that can change. We can either work to maintain habits that allow us to continue to flow  like Marcus’s river, able to wash away any dung thrown into us and erode the mud on the banks so that we become bigger and stronger. Or we can slowly dam off our source until we become a pool that is easily poisoned by the slightest of contaminants. I want to be the best version of me I can be and so I am working on my habits.</p></div>

	<div class="entry__content"><p>Merry Christmas everyone! I hope it went well or at least not awkwardly. I know Christmas is still a tough time for people who are struggling with their family’s politics and also their religious convictions. I have never had to deal with that as it just never comes up. I consider myself “blessed” in that manner. Honestly, I am disappointed as I have spent years on atheist forums and groups that have been filled with stories about arguing with family members about how their god is impossible and thus I’ve picked up so many points and counter points that I have never used.</p></div>

<p>I have recently signed and accepted a job offer with a substantial raise but it is a salaried position.</p>
<p>My entire life I have been warned against the dangers of Salary positions. How they only offer those jobs to people who go above and beyond. Working outside of normal hours to get the job done. So that they no longer have to worry about paying overtime and so that the company can feel obligated to my time outside of “normal” work hours.</p></div>

However, he had a whole set of reasons to hate dating apps saying they&rsquo;re &ldquo;exercise in futility, false hope, and discouragement&rdquo; viewing them as a place of luck where you hate every second of using just hoping you find an out. Which I figured I could share my perspective as someone happily engaged to someone I met on a dating app.</p></div>

I have spent the weekend healing and going over in my head everything I want to tell people about why I did it and what lead me to finally do it. I’ve been listening to podcasts about it and reading stories on Reddit, and I have some thoughts on why I specifically want to get it done. Primarily I wanted to focus on my ideas of selfishness and how it helps us go navigate the human experience.</p></div>

	<div class="entry__content"><p>There is an obvious contradiction in being both an Atheist and an Occultist. How can I believe and
practice Magick and Religious rituals if I do not believe in the powers that I am acting as if I am
controlling? What gives me the right to disrespect these practices and traditions? Simple, it’s fun
and I do not worry about gods or demons smiting me.</p>
<p>That is of course the short version. There’s a longer version of course. There are two main ideas that
keep me practicing. The main idea is concepts like Habit Triggers and Manifestation.</p></div>

<p>Firearms are tools that are there to help you survive in either a deadly confrontation or a dire survival
situation. They are not toys. You can certainly have fun with them, but there is a real gravity to being a
firearms owner that should never be lost on you. It is a tool but it&rsquo;s purpose is to kill and you can never
forget that.</p></div>

	<div class="entry__content"><p>It’s been 3 years since Jacob went to rehab. It’s been a long road to recovery since then and they say  it never ends.</p>
<p>Merideth has been supportive of her son the whole time he’s been away. He told her all about the theater troupe he joined and that play about the King he was in. Not as the king, but one of his servants. He’s detailed his whole time working for that fast food chicken place, Lucky Clucky’s, and how much it’s meant to the both of them that he’s managed to keep and hold this job for so long. Of course, much of this success he attributes to the Lord for giving him purpose. Merideth never asked what denomination he turned to while in the big city because she was just happy that he had a relationship with God.<br>
         The time had finally come for a Clucky’s to open in Merideth and Jacob’s home town and they asked Jacob to be the General Manager! <br>
        	Three years. Merideth wondered how much he had changed in three years. Of course Jacob called all the time and she knows all about his doings, but there’s something different about people over the phone than there is when you really get to be with them. Honestly though, Merideth doesn’t care how different he is. Merideth is a good mother and wouldn’t even care if jacob had resented her for sending him off like that. He was so mad it was a year before Jacob even returned her call.</p></div>
