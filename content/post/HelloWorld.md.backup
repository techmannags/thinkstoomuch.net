# Welcome to my Site!

This is my blog... I guess. 

I've been wanting to find a place to collect and share my ideas for years now. Hopefully this becomes a regular habit that I can maintain for years, but we need to start small by starting the site and introducing what I do.

## Things to see

I am an avid enjoyer of what I believe to be a stereotypical collection of hobbies: Hiking, History, Philosophy, Politics, Art, and Computers!

I talk a lot about what ever comes up in therapy this week or stuff that I talk about with coworkers or friends over coffee (though I am more of a tea fan). 

## Background

I have 4 years of college behind me in both computer science and history. I have worked state government and private sector IT along with years of a slew of fun jobs before I settled back on my first love of computers.

## Politics

I am in a queer relationship. I firmly believe gun rights are queer rights. I'm pretty lefty, but to lebel myself as anything specific is weird and not useful at all. The fascists don't care if you're a Marxist Lenninist or an Anarchist. The west is so far from a communist revolution because of our reletive comfort (even under a pending Trump rule) that I'm not convinvced.

The best I think we can do is build up our communities, stay connected to our neighbors, and prepare for anything. Build those mutual aide networks!
