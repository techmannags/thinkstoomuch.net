My altar is less aesthetically pleasing than mosts I have seen posted on the Tumblrs and Instagrams of the world. It has a vibe to it that I enjoy.  

It is based vaguely on the description in Oberron Zell-Ravenloft's "Grimoire for the Apprentice Wizard" in that it has a representative of all four elements(earth, water, wind, fire) and it has a higher and lower teir to represent our higher and lower self.  The shelf that separates the two is a black box that I have painted with symbols that are important to me. One is the symbol for the demon king Zagan (who's name I stole to give to my cat Zagan) and the other is a Triquetra a symbol for unity and interconnectedness, something I value in myself and society. I painted them with silver paint which I just thought looks cool and I wear a lot of silver but the symbolism of silver in occultism is a connection to feminine energies and the moon. 

### Things to include by Element
Earth - rocks (duh). I have Labradorite. It's my favorite semi-precious gemstone because it's pretty, but it's hard to find the parts that are pretty. You need the right light and angle to find the shiny beauty spots. It's a reminder that beauty is always visible but not always immediately. One must look to find beauty in all things because all things are beautiful.

Water - Water (duh). I have a few vials of water on my altar. One is a jar of river water from my home town that I collected after a flood. The other is water from Lake Superior I collected on vacation there where I met some kindly witches collecting stones on the beach (like I was doing). It is equal parts a reminder of good times and the fluidity of time. Much like the river flows and the lake washes new stones onto the beach, so to does time flow and things change. Not always for the better, but we must carry on to find new beauty.

Air - Bells and Feathers. I have bells from all over that I've thrifted over the years. They make all kinds of chimes some deep, some light, some far too pingy and I get annoyed having to move them, but all of them are only making noise for a moment and that moment is long enough to drastically change my mindset. These are often actual tools as opposed to purely symbolic meditations. Much like Pavlov making dogs think of food, I use bells to pull myself out of whatever mundane drudgery I am experiencing and immerse myself in meditation. Although, to be honest, I am mostly using a meditation app with a gong sound more than bells.

The feathers I've collected from various places and types of birds (none I killed but many were deceased). Birds are wonderful symbols of freedom and letting go. View it as a symbol for that. Let your mind be free like the bird is free to explore and travel where it pleases. Follow a bird around one day. It's a wonderful type of meditation.

Fire - Candles and Incense. Candles and incense are such an essential aspect of modern witchcraft and occultism that you can find lists of meanings and uses for certain colors and scents all over. Since I'm an atheist, I know it doesn't matter and gave myself meaning and uses. Hell, I "summoned a demon" using battery powered tea lights and a essential oil diffuser because my dorm banned candles. So I have three preferred candle colors: red, green, purple. When I am working, I burn a red candle. When I am meditatating, a green candle (placed on the higher shelf of the altar). When I am relaxing, the purple candle. 

Why those colors? I really like the color red and the other two were on sale at Hobby Lobby so I bought a bunch.




If it pleases you, one could say it's a grounding point to remember the assigned feminine attributes that we should all experience and true balance comes from mastery of the feminine and masculine parts of life making us genderless gods once we've reobtained our whole power by superseding the binary!

Altars are the physical manifestation of a higher consciousness. It is where we worship the spiritual ideal. They are living works of art that represent the true us through 

## What is an Altar to me

My altar is a place for ritual. It's a grounding space for me that I use to take me out of whatever mindset I'm in and enter into an appropriate one. It's my portal into my own psyche and my own place to

## What is in an Altar

Altars can be constructed of anything for anything. The important part is that this is a space for you to maintain a physical connection to your practice. Whether you are actually worshipping something or worshipping yourself or some weird pseudo god idea, this is a part of your physical space

My altar is from Oberron Zell-Ravenloft's "Grimoire for the Apprentice Wizard". Though the book feels like a mad man explaining how to be so unhinged that no one bothers approaching him. It follows a basic structure of two tiers and four elements.
