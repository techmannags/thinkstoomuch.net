# Welcome to my Site!

This is my blog... I guess. 

I've been wanting to find a place to collect and share my ideas for years now. Hopefully this becomes a regular habit that I can maintain for years, but we need to start small by starting the site and introducing what I do.

## Things to see

I am an avid enjoyer of what I believe to be a stereotypical collection of hobbies: Hiking, History, Philosophy, Politics, Art, and Computers!

I talk a lot about what ever comes up in therapy this week or stuff that I talk about with coworkers or friends over coffee (though I am more of a tea fan). 

Lately, I have been obsessed with engaging in witchcraft and occult practices to build my own religion without the problems or dogma of a properly organized religion. I don't even have a god since "They're more trouble than they're worth" - Worf

## Background

I have 4 years of college behind me in both computer science and history. I have worked state government and private sector IT along with years of a slew of fun jobs before I settled back on my first love of computers.

Most of my History studies have been in Post Roman Europe and lately I've been dedicating serious time to actually studying Rome. It was something I avoided for years for fear of associating with fascists, but I decided they don't get to read 2000 year old gossip without me and my lefty opinions.

## Politics

I am in a queer relationship. I firmly believe gun rights are queer rights. I'm pretty lefty, but to label myself as anything specific is weird and not useful at all. The fascists don't care if you're a Marxist Lenninist or an Anarchist. The west is so far from a communist revolution because of our relative comfort (even under a Trump rule) that I'm not convinvced we'll see anything drastic until things decline.

Update 11-21-2025: Yikes. Anyways.

The best I think we can do is build up our communities, stay connected to our neighbors, and prepare for anything. Build those mutual aide networks!
