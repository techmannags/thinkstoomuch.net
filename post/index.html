	<div class="entry__content">Welcome to my Site! This is my blog&hellip; I guess.
I&rsquo;ve been wanting to find a place to collect and share my ideas for years now. Hopefully this becomes a regular habit that I can maintain for years, but we need to start small by starting the site and introducing what I do.
Things to see I am an avid enjoyer of what I believe to be a stereotypical collection of hobbies: Hiking, History, Philosophy, Politics, Art, and Computers!</div>

	<div class="entry__content">Intro I don’t kill anything! To make that clear off the bat, but I tend to notice when things break or plants die right as major changes happen. And it’s all because of that damn witch in my home town!
Origins Eight years ago I wore a promise ring that my girlfriend at the time bought me as a going to college present. I loved that thing as it reminded me of her while also being a beautiful ring and sturdy too.</div>

	<div class="entry__content">Life is a series of rituals. You wake up and do your morning rituals of making your bed, brushing your teeth and showering. These are signals in your mind that you need to transition into a new mindset. You are no longer in sleeping mode and need to be in awake mode. The ritual of Coffee or Tea in the morning is more a symbolic waking up than it is a necessity for caffeine.</div>

	<div class="entry__content">“A man standing by a spring of clear, sweet water and cursing it. While the fresh water keeps on bubbling up. He can shovel mud into it, or dung, and the stream will carry it away, wash itself clean, remain unstained.”
― Marcus Aurelius, Meditations
Human Nature and Habits Humans are an ever growing ever changing beast, but through habits that can change. We can either work to maintain habits that allow us to continue to flow like Marcus’s river, able to wash away any dung thrown into us and erode the mud on the banks so that we become bigger and stronger.</div>

	<div class="entry__content">Intro Merry Christmas everyone! I hope it went well or at least not awkwardly. I know Christmas is still a tough time for people who are struggling with their family’s politics and also their religious convictions. I have never had to deal with that as it just never comes up. I consider myself “blessed” in that manner. Honestly, I am disappointed as I have spent years on atheist forums and groups that have been filled with stories about arguing with family members about how their god is impossible and thus I’ve picked up so many points and counter points that I have never used.</div>

	<div class="entry__content">Intro I have recently signed and accepted a job offer with a substantial raise but it is a salaried position.
My entire life I have been warned against the dangers of Salary positions. How they only offer those jobs to people who go above and beyond. Working outside of normal hours to get the job done. So that they no longer have to worry about paying overtime and so that the company can feel obligated to my time outside of “normal” work hours.</div>

However, he had a whole set of reasons to hate dating apps saying they&rsquo;re &ldquo;exercise in futility, false hope, and discouragement&rdquo; viewing them as a place of luck where you hate every second of using just hoping you find an out.</div>

	<div class="entry__content">Intro December 6th 2024, I received a vasectomy at the age of 27. I have spent the weekend healing and going over in my head everything I want to tell people about why I did it and what lead me to finally do it. I’ve been listening to podcasts about it and reading stories on Reddit, and I have some thoughts on why I specifically want to get it done. Primarily I wanted to focus on my ideas of selfishness and how it helps us go navigate the human experience.</div>

	<div class="entry__content">There is an obvious contradiction in being both an Atheist and an Occultist. How can I believe and practice Magick and Religious rituals if I do not believe in the powers that I am acting as if I am controlling? What gives me the right to disrespect these practices and traditions? Simple, it’s fun and I do not worry about gods or demons smiting me.
That is of course the short version.</div>

What to know Firearms are tools that are there to help you survive in either a deadly confrontation or a dire survival situation. They are not toys. You can certainly have fun with them, but there is a real gravity to being a firearms owner that should never be lost on you.</div>
